**Command to run:**
- Load Scrum Master agent (`bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md`) and execute `*create-story` targeting Story 1.6.
- After drafting, run `story-ready` and `story-context` to prepare the implementation package.

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** web (Web Application)  
- **Project Level:** 4  
- **Instruction Set:** Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 (enterprise scope)  
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** greenfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** TBD during PRD discovery  
- **Estimated Stories:** TBD  
- **Estimated Epics:** TBD  
- **Timeline:** TBD

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** Not applicable (new build)  
- **Team Size:** TBD  
- **Deployment Intent:** TBD

## Recommended Workflow Path

1. Engage PM agent for `prd` to establish product requirements and epics.  
2. Run PM agent `ux-spec` to define UX flows and UI structure.  
3. Hand off to Architect for `solution-architecture`, then `tech-spec (per epic, JIT)`.  
4. Transition to SM/DEV workflows in Phase 4 once planning deliverables are complete.
