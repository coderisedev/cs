# Airbus vs Boeing: Choosing the Right Cockpit Hardware for Your Sim

*The eternal debate in aviation extends to flight simulation. Should you build an Airbus or Boeing cockpit? Here's everything you need to know to make the right choice for your setup.*

---

## Introduction

Every flight simmer eventually faces the question: Airbus or Boeing?

It's not just about which aircraft looks cooler or which airline you prefer. When investing in dedicated cockpit hardware, you're choosing an ecosystem—a philosophy of flight, a set of procedures, and a community of fellow enthusiasts.

This guide breaks down the fundamental differences between Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 cockpit hardware, helps you understand which platform matches your flying style, and provides practical advice for building your ideal home cockpit.

---

## The Philosophy Divide

Before comparing specific hardware, it's essential to understand the fundamental design philosophies that shape these cockpits.

### Boeing: Pilot Authority

Boeing's design philosophy puts the pilot firmly in command:

- **Direct control** — Inputs translate directly to control surfaces
- **Override capability** — Pilots can always override automation
- **Traditional feel** — Control column (yoke) with conventional feedback
- **Manual reversion** — Systems designed for graceful degradation

The 737 cockpit reflects decades of evolution from the original 737-100. Controls feel mechanical and direct. When you move the yoke, you're physically connected to the flight control system.

### Airbus: Fly-by-Wire Automation

Airbus embraced computerized flight control from the A320's inception:

- **Flight envelope protection** — Computer prevents dangerous maneuvers
- **Sidestick control** — Small, precise input device
- **Automation-centric** — Designed around autopilot usage
- **Law-based control** — Normal, Alternate, and Direct control laws

The A320 cockpit represents a clean-sheet design optimized for efficiency. Inputs are requests that the flight computer interprets within safe parameters.

### What This Means for Hardware

These philosophies directly impact hardware design:

| Aspect | Boeing 737 | Airbus A320 |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Primary input | Yoke (control column) | Sidestick |
| Autopilot panel | MCP (Mode Control Panel) | FCU (Flight Control Unit) |
| FMS interface | CDU (Control Display Unit) | MCDU (Multipurpose CDU) |
| Thrust control | Traditional throttle quadrant | Detented thrust levers |
| Trim | Manual trim wheel | Electric trim switches |

### Throttle Quadrant Comparison

The throttle quadrant reveals the starkest philosophical differences.

**Boeing 737 Throttle**

Traditional, fully manual design:

- **Moving thrust levers** — Autothrottle moves the levers physically
- **Speed brake lever** — Manual deployment with detents
- **Trim wheel** — Large, tactile manual trim
- **Flap lever** — Mechanical detents for each position
- **Reverse thrust** — Interlock mechanism for safety

**CS 737X TQ Features:**
- 4 brushless motors + 5 stepper motors
- Motorized autothrottle synchronization
- Authentic detent positions
- Full reverse thrust simulation
- Optional fire warning panel base

**Airbus A320 Throttle**

Designed for automation:

- **Detented thrust levers** — TOGA, FLX/MCT, CLB, IDLE, REV positions
- **Non-moving autothrust** — Levers stay in CLB detent during autothrust
- **Speed brake** — Simpler design
- **Flap lever** — Different detent positions than Boeing
- **Engine masters** — Unique start/stop design

**Key Difference:**

In a Boeing, when autothrottle adjusts power, you watch the thrust levers move. In an Airbus, the levers typically stay in CLB detent while the system manages thrust—you see the effect on the engine displays, not the physical levers.

### Winner by Category

| Category | Winner | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Visual feedback | Boeing | Moving levers show autothrottle action |
| Simplicity | Airbus | Fewer moving parts |
| Tactile feel | Boeing | More mechanical feedback |

## Can You Have Both?

A common question: can you build a dual-type cockpit?

### The Honest Answer

**Technically possible, but not ideal.**

Here's why:

1. **Different panel positions** — MCP and FCU mount differently
2. **Conflicting muscle memory** — Procedures differ significantly
3. **Cost doubles** — Two complete panel sets needed
4. **Switching overhead** — Reconfiguration between types takes time

### Practical Alternatives

**Option 1: Software switching with generic panels**

Use generic flight sim hardware and switch between aircraft in software. Loses authenticity but gains flexibility.

**Option 2: Dedicated primary, virtual secondary**

Build complete hardware for your primary type, use virtual cockpit for occasional flights in the other type.

**Option 3: Modular cockpit frame**

Build a frame that accepts swappable panel modules. Higher cost and complexity, but achievable.

### Our Recommendation

**Pick one type and master it.**

The depth of simulation available in modern add-ons rewards specialization. You'll develop better procedures, faster muscle memory, and deeper system knowledge by focusing on one platform.

Most professional pilots fly one type for years. Your sim should reflect that commitment.
