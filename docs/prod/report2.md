1. HUGELY impressed by the quality of these units, WOW! This is indeed set of premium products for serious simmers! I will focus on that segment and highlight it appropriately.

2. I got your MCDU when I was already filming both of the units. Rest assured, I will post a thorough review/stream of your product, as its quality is excellent. Their user segment is different, I get a lot of messages about your product from cockpit building folks / more serious simmers.

- Hello Kai,  
- I hope you’ve had a fantastic New Year break! Happy New Year!  
- I wanted to provide a progress update on the content:  
   - I’ve filmed unboxing of both MCDU and FOUEFIB and stand.  
   - I did two streams featuring both products for the audience on YouTube, Facebook and Twitch:  
     - MCDU >  
     - FOUEFIB ->  
     (This one was a very challenging approach, so FOU was put through the best test!)

| AOA MCCI  | I discovered randomly online the CS 320A CDU, I was immediately amazed by the quality of the product and when I received it, it didn’t disappoint! It just looks like the real thing. I brought it with me onboard an A320, put it side by side with the real MCDU, and it actually looked better than the real one! Of course, it’s brand new, but still... You couldn’t tell which one is which in a picture. The touch is great, the product is very high quality and you feel it immediately. It works great on the sim, very fluid, no lag, high quality screen. CS takes care of its customers, they listen to customers feedback in order to improve their product. I’m overall very satisfied with this high-fidelity product, I use it on every flight I do with the A320 family on Microsoft Flight Simulator. If tomorrow I decide to build a home cockpit, or simply want to buy more quality hardware for my setup, I would definitely go for CS products! | **Pilot Jeff** <br> **Shop, Shop & Sappar** |

As I’m type rated on the A320, I would be very happy to give you feedback, share it with my community and showcase what great product you created for flight simulation!
